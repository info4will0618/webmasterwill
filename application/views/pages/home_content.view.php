						Do you have a product(s), service(s), or an idea you want to sell? 
					</p>

					<p>
						Do you want to take advantage of the tool (your website) that let's you reach anyone, anytime (as long as they have access to internet), and use it to effectively sell what you have to offer and make more profit?
					</p>

					<p>
						Then you are in the right place. 
					</p>

					<p>
						My name is William, and I want to help you or your business succeed.
					</p>

					<p>
						We all know that the internet is the future and that we all need a website to represent us.
					</p>

					<p>
						The thing is that a lot people don't know how to use their websites to sell what they have to offer. 
					</p>

					<p>
						But that is not gonna be you because I will show you how you can use your website to it's fullest potential and be in the winner website team.

				</div>
				<div class="home-page_content">
					<p>
						The reason why a lot of websites don't sell is that they don't employ any selling techniques that make people want to buy.
					</p>
				
					<p>
						A lot of people think that having a nice web design or getting a bunch of people to your website through online advertisement are gonna make people wanna buy. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Now those things do help (a lot), but they don't sell.
					</p>

					<p>
						What does sell is knowing why and how people buy and knowing how they search and use the internet.
					</p>

					<p>
						Most websites contain mostly technical information about how their business operates or what is so good about their product or service. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Those things don't get people very interested in what you have to offer.
					</p>

					<p>
						If you want to sell then you must paint the picture on how what you have to offer will benefit your customers.
					</p>

					<p>
						Using selling techniques like copywriting I will show you how you can increase your chances of making people want to desire what you have to offer.
					</p>

	
					<!-- <p>
						<b>Many businesses out there have mediocre websites that don't help them succeed. But that is not gonna be you.</b>
					</p>

					<p>
						That is because business owners and even web designers/developers <b>don't know</b> the process of <b>how and why people buy</b>, specifically on the internet. 
					</p>

					<p>
						I'm not saying it's a bad thing. What I am saying is that <b>selling is a skill</b> that is often overlooked by people and especially when it comes to their websites. 
					</p>

					<p>
						<i><u>Selling, as I define it, is simply the art of figuring out the best way to make a person interested in what you have to offer and want to buy it.</u></i>
					</p>

					<p>
						One thing you must understand about people is that <b>they are not gonna</b> put too much effort, though, or motivate themselves to figure out if they want to buy from you. 
					</p>

					<p>
						<b>It is your website's job to give reason and motivate people to want to buy. </b>
					</p>

					<p>
						A lot of websites <b>don't do this job very well</b> so that's why they are not good at selling or are missing out in a lot of customers and money away (oh no).
					</p>

					<p>
						Using skills such as <b>copywriting</b> (persuasion with your words), an understanding of <b>how and why people buy</b>, and an und erstanding of <b>how people use websites</b> will give you the ability to sell better on your website.

				<div class="home-page_content">
					<p>
						<b>Unfortunately, because some websites are not built to sell, they end up missing a lot of opportunities to make more money</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						People get frustrated because they spend so much time and money on web design services and advertising but don't get any or little return on their investments. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Without implementing a selling strategy on your website, you end up:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Missing opportunities:</b> In the end, no matter how the person got to your website, it is your website that is gonna close the deal. So it makes sense that the better your website is at selling, the greater the chance of making any visitor that lands on your website become a customer. The other way, the more your website is bad at selling, well, the less chance you have in making them into a customer. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Don't let your competitor's win!:</b> If you have competitors and they have websites, people <b>will compare</b> your website to your competitor's website. It is your selling that will separate you from the competition. If your competitor does sell much better than you on their website, and even if their product/service is not better than yours, they can still be getting the customers. So be cautious!
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Let people know what you're all about:</b> Selling is not just about persuading and motivating people to buy. It's about telling people <b>truly what your business is all about</b> and how you can help them.
