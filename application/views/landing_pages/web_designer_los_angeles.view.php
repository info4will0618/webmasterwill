							<b>Many people today do research on your business website before deciding whether they want to buy from you or not.</b>

							Your website is perhaps the most important tool you have in today's digital age.

							It is the way people can see what your business is all about and figure out whether they should do business with you.

						<p>
							You want to make sure that every penny you spent on it is worth its value and does not go to waste?
						</p>
						<p>
							If that is the case, then what you are looking for is a selling website.
						</p>

						<p>
							A selling website is a website that does the best possible to sell any product(s), service(s), or idea(s) you have to offer.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							I know it sounds straightforward and simple, but a lot of business websites online are not optimized for selling.
						</p>

						<p>
							That is because people, including web designers and web agencies, don't understand how people use the internet and how and why people buy.
						</p>
					
						<p>
							If you want your website to get the most money out of your investment. 
						</p>
						<p>
							And you want to have fewer headaches and worries, and instead more confidence and security about your business then I want to show you how you can use your website the best way possible to sell.

					<h3>
						Why you need a website that sells!
					</h3>
					<div class="content_readability">
						<p>
							The reasons why a lot of websites are not good at selling are because of a lack of understanding of how people behave on the internet and why people buy.
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, people will not read your writing on the web if it's not optimized for readability. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Another is that if there is too much information on the screen they are looking at then they might get overwhelmed and consequently just leave from your website.
						</p>
						<h4>
							Why do people buy?
						</h4>
						<p>
							Now, this might seem straightforward, but not so fast. Selling is a skill that requires deep thought. 
						</p>
						<p>
							A lot of websites only tell people about their product, service, or idea. But if you want people to buy, then you must be able to sell to people what you have to offer.
						</p>
						<p>
							Do a quick google search on businesses around your local area and ask yourself how much effort are the businesses website doing to motivate you to want to buy?
						</p>
						<p>
							If you want to maximize the effectiveness of what a website can do for your business then you must use as much space your host provides you with to sell what you have to offer.

						<p>
							Today, more than ever people have easy access to the internet (through their phones and free wifi). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage" target="_blank">Internet usage so far by people around the world</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							There will be a point where pretty much everyone will use it to do research before making a purchasing decision.
						</p>
						<p>
							That means that businesses that don't have websites optimize for selling will fall behind and businesses that do will move forward. (<a href="https://seoexpertbrad.com/local-seo-stats/" target="_blank">Surprising statistics that make you realize how important your website is!</a>)
						</p>
						<p>
							Another problem I see with a lot of businesses is that they spend so much money promoting and advertising their websites. But if their website is not good at selling, a lot of that money just goes to waste.
						</p>
						<p>
							A selling website not only saves you money but increases your ability to make even more with the money you invest.
						</p>
						<p>
							At WebMasterWill, I dissolve that fear of not selling and boost your confidence by helping you build a website that will help you sell.
