					<b>Dear friend,</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					Do you want to move forward in business with a website that's not sitting in the middle of nowhere but actually bringing you more customers to your business?
				</p>

				<p>
					Are you overwhelmed and confused with all the complicated website technical stuff. Instead, you want to fewer headaches and put more time and attention to your business or idea?
				</p>

				<p>
					Don't know where to start? Don't know if you should hire a web agency? Don't know if you should hire a freelancer? Or maybe just do it yourself and see how it goes?
				</p>

				<p>
					Are you worried about whether your money is gonna be worth the investment in a website or you might just be throwing money down the drain?
				</p>

				<p>
					Are you confused about where to start? Whether you should do google search SEO or google ads. Should you do social media marketing? Or just pass out flyers and business cards?
				</p>

				<h3>
					You Don't Have To Worry Anymore, I Have Your Back
				</h3>

				<p>
					Hello, my friend, my name is William. I know how complicated the website world is.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even working and studying for web development found it confusing and hard. 
				</p>

				<p>
					So I want to make it as easy and painless as possible for people to have a successful website. 
				</p>

				<p>
					But how do you build a successful website?
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's start with a story about a guy named Bob then I'll tell you why most websites fail....
				</p>

				<h2>
					The Tragic Story of Bob and His Failed Attempt To Make a Website That Brings Him More Customers
				</h2>
				<p>
					Once upon a time Bob wanted to start a new business.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bob knows he needed a website to have the best possible chance of his business becoming successful. 
				</p>
				<p>
					What should he do? Should he do it himself, invest some time with and little money with a website builder like Wix? 
				</p>
				<p>
					Or should he hire a freelance web developer for a decent price?
				</p>
				<p>
					 Maybe hire someone on Fiverr who does it for a ridiculously low price (with a huge concern on quality and expectations).
				</p>
				<p>
					Or perhaps he should be fearless and go all in with a web agency that not only builds custom beautiful websites but also throws some marketing in with it. After all, the fate of his business idea lies within a well-executed strategy!
				</p>
				<p>
					With an awesome custom built website built with the latest technology and some paid ads that go with it, there is no way it can fail! Right?
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Wrong...</b>
				</p>

				<p>
					After launch day Bob told all his friends and family and waited patiently for his phone and email to explode.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>But no one called...</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Bob even went passing out flyers and business cards but still... He hardly got the results he wanted. 
				</p>
				<p>
					He told himself "Why is no one coming if my website looks beautiful and awesome"! (Crickets, Crickets...).
				</p>
				<p>
					Bob oversaw what I believe is the most important element when it comes to building a selling website. The is <b>Crafting The Message</b>.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>

					Avoid Making The Same Mistake As Bob And Craft A Selling Message That Will Open A River Of Sales
					
				</h3>

				<p>
					Ever been through a situation like Bob's or know someone who has gone through this? Hopefully not! 
				</p>
				<p>
					This story is not real, but I put it here because but It's a general representation of how many people feel when they first built their website or after they have built their websites and get no results. 
				</p>

				<p>
					There is so much more to a website that the design or the technology it's built on. There is an important step that you must take before you create the website itself.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>This step I call it crafting the message</b>.
				</p>

				<p>
					This step is crucial to success for those who need a new website OR for those who want to improve a current website. 
				</p>

				<p>
					It is a step I see people often oversee. They go do stuff like advertising and building nice features into your website. But if you skip this step and jump into doing those other things, it will cost you more money, time, and effort in the long run...
				</p>

			</div>
			
			<div>

				<h2>
					What is Crafting The Message and Why Is It So Important?
				</h2>

				<p>
					Imagine first entering a website. Let's say you clicked it because it came on top number one on a google search result.  
				</p>

				<p>
					It can be a website of an online store, a local shop or restaurant, or whatever you can think of.
				</p>

				<p>
					What is it that is gonna make you buy? Is it the nice design of the website? Is it just the fact that it is number one top of the google search result (high chance but not really)? The price maybe? 
				</p>

				<p>
					There are two obvious ways where you can see how a website makes money.   
				</p>

				<p>
					The first is the amount of traffic (number of visitors) you can get to the website. You do that through stuff like flyers, business cards, word of mouth, online ads, social media, and so on. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The second way is making the website itself good at turning that traffic into buying customers. Things such as the design and user experience are going to help here.
				</p>

				<p>
					People tend to focus a lot on these two things. But there is a third not so obvious thing that people overlook. And that is the message. 
				</p>

				<h3>
					What the hell is The Message and Why Is It So Important?
				</h3>

				<p>
					Before building a website, I believe that the message is the first thing that you need to work on. The message is the reason why people want to do business with you or listen to your idea. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The message is the whole vibe or feel. Remember that people are not buying the website, they are buying your product or service. Your website is just a communication link between the two of you (you and your visitor). You want to make sure that as soon as they enter your website that they can trust you, you are interesting, or you are professional and mostly that you understand them. 
				</p>

				<p>
					The message is going to determine whether people are going to buy from you, come back to your website, or talk to other people about your website and business or idea. 
				</p>

				<h3>
					Everyone Has A Message
				</h3>

				<p>
					No matter if you are a small restaurant, a professional law firm, or a big company. Everyone has a message.
				</p>

				<p>
					The message can be a few sentences, or an entire essay (like this webpage you reading right now). The message can be one picture or a series of pictures.
				</p>

				<p>
					it can be a 30-second video, or a 10+ minute video. Whatever is, crafting a good message that makes people want to do business with you if you want to make a lot of money with your website. 
				</p>

				</p>

				<h3>
					The Message Is An Artwork 
				</h3>

			</div>

			<div>
				
				<p>
					Just like a salesman takes his/her time to craft the perfect presentation to win over a potential buyer, or how a professional advertiser crafts his ad before paying huge amount of bucks for it to go out to the public, you must put time, effort, and thought into crafting your message.
				</p>

				<p>
					A message is truly an entire story about you and your business. 
				</p>

				<h3>
					The Message Is Everything On Your Website Into One 
				</h3>

				<p>
					From the way you talk about your business or idea to the way to describe a product or service, that is all part of the message. 
				</p>

				<p>
					You can always describe a product or service differently. For example, I can have two messages. 1. Here at WebMasterWill, I build awesome websites. Or 2. Here at WebMasterWill, your website will be awesome. 
				</p>

				<p>
					They both are similar but a wise choice of words can make each one sound differently.
				</p>

				<h3> 
					The Message 
				</h3>

				<p>
					The message goes to the root of what your product or service can do for your visitor and expresses it in the clearest, simplest, and most beautiful way possible.
				</p>

				<h3>
					The Message Is The Reason They Will Buy From You
				</h3>

				<p>
					And believe me, this will be the primary reason they will buy from you. They are not going to buy because of your nice looking website, but because your message has sparked an interest in them to want to buy from you.
				</p>

				<p>
					The message as I define it is what comes before building the website and doing the advertising. The most successful businesses and people out there are successful because they put considerable time in thinking about the message. 
				</p>

				<h3>
					Before You Do Anything, Built A Well Crafted Message
				</h3>

				<p>
					Before any effort put on online marketing, paper advertising, word of mouth advertising, social media, on SEO, or anything! You must have a clearly defined, well thought out message, that will make people have interest buying from you. 
				</p>

			</div>

			<div>
					
				<h2>
					Your Website And Everything Else Is Just A Form Of Communication
				</h2>

				<p>
					Words, pictures, videos, and even the website itself is just a form of communication. It is all about what is being said. And it's not just what you are saying that counts, but also how you say it. 
				</p>

				<h3>
					The Book That Opened a new world of web design
				</h3>

				<p>
					I went to Barnes and Noble's one day to search for a book on improving my web development skills. Like a total nerd, I was looking for a book that will help me code better. 
				</p>
				<p>
					But then I stumbled upon some other type of book that will change the way I looked at websites <b>forever</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The book was called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/161448502X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=161448502X&linkCode=as2&tag=info4will0618-20&linkId=3e53570ec183ef842105358e75ca45c5">How to Write Copy That Sells: The Step-By-Step System for More Sales, to More Customers, More Often</a>. (Very good book if you want to learn how to use words to get people to buy).
				</p>

				<p>
					It was not the book itself that change my viewpoint about web design. It was the fact that I overlooked something that was extremely important to a website, especially a website that sells.
				</p>

				<p>
					The book made me realize how words can influence and motivate(to take action) people. 
				</p>

				<p>
					I looked back to every website and saw that I didn't really care much about the use of words on websites. I also saw that most people like website owners don't put enough thought to the words they use to describe their business or idea.
				</p>

				<p>
					Yes, a lot of websites have plenty of words. But they were the wrong words. Words that don't sell. 
				</p>

				<p>
					If you want your business or idea to stand out, it's about what you say and how you say it. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Words can take your product or service and make your customers motivation of buying it jump up to the sky! 
				</p>

				<h3>
					And What About The Other Forms Of Communication?
				</h3>

				<p>
					What about pictures and videos William?
				</p>

				<p>
					After that book opened my eyes to how words can impact how visitors interact with a website, I started to look for more things that I was not aware. Things that will help me understand how people interact on a website and eventually want to buy or contact you. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Yes, pictures and videos also have a huge impact on your visitors and customers. But the same concept I said about words applies to pictures and videos. 
				</p>

				<p>
					And it's not just text, pictures, and videos that motivate and influence people. But colors, where an element such as an order button or call button is placed on a website, how text is formatted, how easy it is for a visitor to look for something, and I can keep going and going. 
				</p>
				 
				<p>
					And I did not only learn how a website can be used to make people want to buy, but I also started learning about the psychology of how people buy. Knowing how people buy gives me even more insight into how to build a website that sells. 
				</p>

				<p>
					I started seeing websites in a whole new way. Now I don't just think about how to build a website, but how to build one that is able to sell your product or service effectively.    
				</p>

				<p>
					Deep down to the core I was learning the psychology of how people behave and interact on a website.

				<h3>
					It's Time To Start Getting More Customers to Your Website
				</h3>
				<p>
					How many customers come to you or your store because of your website? 
				</p>
				<p>
					How much more money can you be making if you double, triple, quadruple, or even 10X the number of customers you get from your website?
				</p>
				<p>
					A website is a 24/7 salesman (or women) online. How effective do you want that sales person to be at selling your product or service? How effective do you want them to be at selling your idea? Your artwork?
