				You know that you need a website (or improve one) to move forward in business or personal success. 
			</p>

			<p>
				 But there is so much confusion out there about what is the best way to approach web design out there.
			</p>

			<p>
				What should I do? Hire a web designer/developer or do it my own? If I hire someone, should it be a freelancer or web agency?
			</p>
			<p>
				If I do it on my own, should I use WordPress, Wix, Shopify, or Squarespace? What if I need a  technology that can highly scale my business, what framework or language should I use? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Is it worth my investment? Will I be able to trust my web developer/designer?  How much should I pay for web design services? 
			</p>
			<p>
				And I can keep going on, and on. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				It's All About The Customers
			</h3>
			<p>
				But let's stop for a second and think about what YOU want as a business owner or professional. You care about satisfying more customers, growing your business, and making more money.
			</p>
			<p>
				People get caught up on so many things like these questions and best practices like "the best technologies you should use or best design for your website".  They forget the main purpose of their website is to satisfy customers that are gonna be the ones paying you. 
			</p>

				I really didn't know what to do though until I stumbled upon a book called "How To Write Copy That Sells". 
			</p>
			<p>
				That later made me want to learn more about how to use words that sell, how to make that video sells, how to use pictures that sell. Ultimately I started learning about human psychology (why people buy) and how to apply all these things to "make a website that sells".
			</p>
			<p>
				You probably have heard of this concept before, it's called website conversion optimization. I don't want to get too fancy with it though, just know it's the art of making more customers that land on your website to want to buy from you.

			<h3>
				Why should you care about CO?
			</h3>

			<p>
				A lot of people jump ahead and try to get as many customers as they can through advertising in places like Facebook, Google, SEO, and even just traditional word of mouth.  
			</p>

			<p>
				The problem is that they forget that even if a lot of people to visit your website, it's up to your website to convince people to buy.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you focus first on making sure your website can make visitors into customers, then the money you invest in advertising will be much more worth it.
			</p>

			<p>
				It's up to your website to convince people to want to buy. Your website is just a communication platform that connects your business to your customers.  
			</p>

			<p>
				It's all about how well and effectively you are able to communicate to your customers online about your business that matters in your website. It's all about the "message".
			</p>

			<p>
				So the question you should always be asking yourself is "what is the best way I can tell my customers that I can help them and that they should buy from me".
			</p>
		<div>
			<h3>
				Focus on the content more than anything
			</h3>
			<p>
				Your website is just a platform, a communication link between your business and your customers. Its really about how you tell your customers that you can fix their problems and needs or satisfy their needs. So you have to focus on the content you have on your website. The content on your website is what's gonna make people buy. That is the stuff they read, videos they watch, pictures they see etc. 
			</p>
			<p>
				We will make sure we do research so you have the best content people that people are looking for about your business. 
			</p>
			<h3>
				It's not just about having content, it's how you communicate the content
			</h3>
			<p>
				A lot of businesses might have good information about their business online and might have even dedicated good time on stuff like videos and photography.
			</p>
			<p>
				But it's not just about the information or amount of content you have, it's about HOW you represent that content.
			</p>
			<p>
				You should always be asking yourself the question "what is the best way I can let my customers know that I can help them and that they should buy from me"?
			</p>
			<p>
				You can always improve the message. You can two different set of paragraphs, two different videos, two different pictures, but one will have a greater impact on your visitor than the other. That means you can always make someone more inclined to want to buy from you.
			</p>

			<p>
				That means you can always make someone more inclined to want to buy from you.
			</p>

			<p>
				It can be a competitive advantage for your business. It can be the difference between a couple of hundred dollars to thousands and even millions of dollars.
