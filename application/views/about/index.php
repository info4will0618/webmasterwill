			Ever since I was a kid I was amazed by the invention of computer technology (props to all those who were part of the creation). And ever since I wanted to learn all about it and use it to help people grow in any aspect of their lives whether it's business, education, or talent.

			I started out as a computer tech, then went on into networking, and now I'm here doing web development. The internet is one of the most awesome things that has happened to humanity. I have been learning web development for about four years now. The internet has been one of the most awesome things that have happened to humanity (thanks to all those who made it possible). I am amazed at how the internet has changed the world and how it continues to do so. I want to use the power of the internet to help people in their business, services, or passion. Every day I continue to learn and expand my knowledge to be able to provide different ways to help people using the internet.
