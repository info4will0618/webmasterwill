	<h2>Thank's a Million for Your Web Services Request <u><?php echo $firstName; ?></u></h2>

	<p>I can't wait to start working in your next big project.</p>

	<p>
		I have sent an email to the address <b><?php echo $email;?></b>. I only accept one request at a time per email for the first request sent by that email. Once your request is approved you can send me more request for that email if you have more projects you need to work on (that will be awesome :) ).If you have any more web request you like to make or want to add more information to your current request, no worries. You can tell me all about your other ideas when I get back to you for this current request.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm going to get back to you as soon as I can through the information you provided me with. If you believe there is any mistake with the information you provided or if I haven't responded to you soon enough please don't hesitate to contact me at <b>william@webmasterwill.com</b>. I promise I'll get back to you.
	</p>

	<p>
		Once again thank you for your request for my services. I will be preparing myself for your project so be ready to tell me all your ideas and have organized all your web assets (pics, content, vids, etc.).

	<p>
		Talk to you soon.
