				Hello, my name is William Sanchez and I build effective websites.
			</p>
			<p>
				What are effective websites? 
			</p>
			<p>
				An effective website to me is a website that is awesome, unique, and informative. It does not have to be overly complicated, but it does need to get the point of your business/product/idea delivered.
			</p>
			<p>
				An effective website is a website that gets people interested about your product/service/idea. It provides enough information to get them engaged and curious about what you have to offer. It also immediately answers any critical questions people may have about your product or service.
			</p>
			<p>
				An effective website also needs to be easily navigatable. All the information is organized in such a way that it makes it easy for the viewer to find it fast. The more easily accessible the information is, the more engaged the viewer will be.
			</p>
			<p>
				In today's time's people do a lot of research before making any decisions. The internet has changed the landscape in which people do business. Your website is a virtual representation of your business. First impressions count, a lot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A bad, plain, or ridiculous looking website makes your website look bad. People base a whole lot of trust on how your website looks.
			</p>
			<p>
				A website is extremely important and without one, you are losing a lot of potential for your business or profile. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But remember that a website is only as effective as you make it be. A website is an investment. The more you work on your website, the more effective it will be. And believe, having an effective website is one of the best investments you can make for your business.
			</p>
			<p>
				And the quality of your website determines the trustworthiness of your brand. Bluntly, if your website sucks then people think your brand or profile sucks even though you might offer a quality product, service, or any form of art or idea.
			</p>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are looking to build a website that is beautiful and unique and has my 100% support at all times, then you are in the right place. Your website is a huge representation of your business or profile. It's pretty much the virtual face of your business or profile.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now any basic website can be built using cheap web builder tools. But is that what you want? A basic website? I don't think so. Remember that a website is a huge representation of your business in today modern world. You want a website that stands out from the crowd. You also want a website that can communicate with your customer, fans, clients, readers, etc.. very well. Together we can achieve that.
			</p>
			<p>
				 Once you have a website set up, it won't stop there. Over time you'll realize that a static website is not a good website. Also that advertising a website is an extremely effective marketing strategy that does not require much to start. So if you are ready to start your website or improve one, then <a href="/webmasterwill/contact">contact me</a> as soon as you can!
