		<h1 class="header-mid">Cost of a Website</h1>

		<p>
			The cost of my service is going to be determined by several factors. These factors are determined by the need of your business or personal goals. The main factors that contribute to the cost of the website are :
		</p>


	<h2>Type of Website?</h2>

		<h3>What type of website is it going to be?</h3>

		<p>
			What type of website is it going to be? Is it going to be a landing page where you just need basic information about your business, company, personal branding, etc...? Is it going to be a blog where you are constantly uploading information? Maybe an e-commerce website where you need to sell products. Or perhaps an informational website that's meant to teach or any other purpose. 
		</p>

	<h2>Design</h2>
		
		<p>
			Usually, the design is something I already include when starting to build a website. But if it more complicated and requires more time to construct then that is another cost to consider.
		</p>

	<h2>Data</h2>

		<p>
			How much data does the website have? I don't usually charge is a website has a couple pages and each page has a considerable amount of information. But if a website has many pages then that's another thing to consider. There is a difference between a 5-page website, 20-page website, and 100-page website. The 100-page website obviously takes more time to build and maintain. 
		</p>

	<h2>Website features or functionality?</h2>
		
		<p> 
			Are there any other features that the website is going to require? Email newsletters? User logging and registration? Sliders or other forms of animation? These are all little things that add up in time.  
		</p>

	<h2> Putting Everything together </h2>

		<h3> So ultimately what is the average or rough estimate of the cost of a typical website?</h3>

		<p>
			So ultimately what is the average or rough estimate of the cost of a typical website? Well by now you must know it depends on several factors. But I'm always willing to negotiate. You see I love to learn, be creative and helpful. I don't charge based on time. I charge based on per project basis. So whenever you are ready to start building your awesome website, grab a pen and paper and write down all the requirements and features you want your website to have. Remeber, you get what you pay for!
