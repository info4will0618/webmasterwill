		<h2 class="">What can I do for you?</h2>
		<p>
			From build a basic landing page (or complex one) to building a blog or ecommerce website. I have a variety of skills under my belt to help reach your business goal. 
		</p>
		<h2>Here are </h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I can build your website exactly how you want it. I build websites from the ground up, no frameworks or layouts. So whatever you have in your imagination, just give it to me and I'll make it happen.
			</li>
			<li>
				I'll build your website for any device and every device. Mobile, tablet, computer, very huge computer, or very small computer. I'll make it fit it and make it look pretty into whatever screen. 
			</li>
			<li>
				I can build you a blog, gallery, e-commerce, etc... Whatever type of website that works with a database I can build. I use MySQL as the primary database for work. If your application requires any other type of database I can easily figure out how to work with it.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you are a business and need to stand out there in terms of marketing I can do my best to set good SEO foundation for the website.
			</li>
			<li>
				Any graphics or artwork that you need to be done on the website I can do!
