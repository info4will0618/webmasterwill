<!-- 			<p>
				How well known is your brand or business?
			</p>
 -->
			<p>
				 Are you wondering if you need a website for your business, services, or passion? 
			</p>

			<p>
				Do you feel like your website needs improvement because it looks out of date and/or does not really bring much success to your business/project.
			</p>

			<p>
				Well first I must say that If you really want to increase the success of your business then you NEED to have a website. And not just any website. You need a website that's built with success in mind. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Hello, my name <a href="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root']; ?>/about">William</a> and I help business and people out through web development. I don't just build you a website, I encourage you to extend your website to become more dynamic and interactive with your visitors.
			</p>

			<p>
				Although just a websites basic landing page has a huge impact on your visitors, extending your website can further increase that impact.
			</p>

			<p>
				A website can be an important aspect of your business or service. I want to help by providing you with a well-designed website that can interact with your visitors and convert them to clients or fans. 
			</p>

			</p>

			<p>
				Also if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. I would like to learn about your business or passion and give you advice, ideas, or information about how to use a website to progress in your business or passion.
			</p>

			<p>
				Technology is spreading fast and everyone will eventually be able to have access to the internet either through a phone, tablet, or a computer and they will also be able to access it from anywhere. A website will be one of the main things people will look into when deciding whether to do business with you or find out more information about who you are.
			</p>

			<p>
				So are you prepared to invest in your business and build your awesome website? Well then check out my <a href="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root']; ?>/services">services</a> and let me know when we are able to start working together! Thank you for your consideration!

				Look at my website. It's compelling and that's what you need.

			<h3>My Purpose</h3>

			<img src="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root']; ?>/public/dist/imgs/succeed.jpg">

			<p>
				 I'm going to be mentioning the word <i>success</i> many times because that's my purpose (for both of us). 
			</p>

			<p>
				Success, success, success, success!
			</p>

			<p>
				I want to help people succeed. And more specifically succeed by using the power of the web. I believe a beautiful and professional website can help people achieve their goals whether in business, project or any idea one has.
			</p>

			<p>
				Many people underestimate how a website can help them in their business. People also don't realize or know how a website can be utilized to drive your business to success.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this article <a href="">How to use a website to achieve success</a> I explain the ways you can use your website to push yourself or business towards success.
			</p>

			<p>
				Every website is built differently depending on what type of business you run or project you plan on doing. And every website needs different features again depending on the business or project.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, a restaurant can have a reservation system feature while a small business store can have a feature that notifies people when a new product has come in.
			</p>

			<p>
				I can implement all these features to a website so their chances of success increase.
			</p>

			<p>
				For now you must understand that it's essential for your business to have a website if you want your business to have the highest amount of success possible.

				The cost of a website is going to depend on several or even many factors that are going to come from your part. I can't truly quote you on a website without knowing what those factors are. So instead I want you to really think about what you need for your website and let me know so I can give you an estimate of my service. Send me a <a id="request-for-proposal" href="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root'];?>">request for proposal</a> and give me all your thoughts and ideas so I can give you an estimate for the cost of my services :).
			</p>

			<h3>What type of website do you need?</h3>

				<p>
					Is it going to be an e-commerce website? Blog? Booking system? 4+ landing page? 
				</p>

			<h3>Size of website</h3>

				<p>
					How big is your website going to be? How many pages? If it's an e-commerce website, how many products are you going to post up for sale? Are you going to consistently be posting up new products? I have to know all the details.
				</p>

			<h3>
				Any special features your website needs?</h3>

				<p>
					 Maybe a custom form that asks people what their favorite restaurant dish or drink is? Maybe a reservation system for a restaurant, car dealership, or gym. All the creative awesome feature you want your website to have you must let me know :).
				</p>

			<h3>Custom crazy creative designs.</h3>

			<p>
				 Depending on how crazy creative your design is, just remember that everything takes time xD. You can have some crazy idea like have a landing page with 20 different boxes that have links that lead somewhere else. Or maybe you want pictures to overlap other pictures in a series of pictures. Whatever it is, just remember it takes time to build. Usually, I just recommend a beautiful landing page that gets's your brand out there loud and clear. But whatever you can imagine I'll try to build, so let's do it!
			</p>

			<p>
				You see it's hard to determine the cost of a website without much feedback from your part, the true owner of the website. I suggest leaving me a <a id="request-for-proposal" href="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root']; ?>/request">request for web proposal</a> and enter some of your thoughts so I can give you a rough estimate on how much your website will be :).
			</p>
 -->
			<!-- <h3>What are your long-term and short-term goals for your website?</h3> -->
<!-- 
			<h3>Budget</h3>

			<p>
				Realistically how much are you willing or can invest in a website? Depending on how much your budget is, that's how much we are going to be able to work with. Remember that a website can be both a short-term and long-term investment. A website should also be considered an important investment. You should read my blog post on why you or your business should have a professional beautifully-designed website. If you are low on a budget we can start building a basic landing homepage and scale up. We can even work out some payments on higher budget websites if we have to. Just know that your budget will determine how much work I can do for your website.
			</p>

			<p>
				
				Are you going to be consistently posting (articles or products) to your website? Does your website need any special kind of functionality like a reservation system for a restaurant? These are all questions to consider before determining the price of a website. So before we further talk about a price for a website it's a good idea to write down all the features you want for your website. Once you have an idea how you want your website to be built I can quote you a cost for the job. 

			</p> -->
<!-- 			<p>
				It's hard to predict the cost of a website without sitting down and having a talk about what goals are your trying to accomplish with your website. It's a good thing to take a moment and write down what you are trying to achieve and how is a website going to do that for you. Then we can start building this masterplan website piece by piece. Remeber Rome was not built in a day and you don't need to invest a whole lot of money at once. We can divide your website into several projects if it's going to be a long journey. You can pay for whatever is needed at the moment and keep investing in the scalability of your website over time. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Once you have a good idea of how you want your website to look and feel, we can talk about it in detail so I know what I have to do. Having all your ideas and goals written down will help me tremendously before discussing how I'm going to determine the cost of the website. All these goals and ideas will then be written in a contract. These goals and ideas are broken down into one project, or several projects down the road. For each project, we will discuss a prize. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I suggest you leave me a website proposal if you are serious about getting a professional website up and running already. Here you can give me a quick idea of what to expect so we can start getting things moving:
			</p>

			<a style="margin-bottom: 20px; display: block;" href="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root']; ?>/request">Send me a website proposal!</a>

			<h3> Guidelines </h3>

			<h4>Here are some policies that you should know that I abide to: </h4>

			<ul>
				<li>
					I believe that the minimal cost of a good basic website is at least is $600.00. I don't accept anything lower than that. I build high-quality websites and put time into building them beautifully and professionally. 
				</li>
				<li>
					I work with a 33.33%, 33.33%, 33.33% rule of payments. That means that I expect 33.33% cost of the entire project upfront and then another 33.33% for the first draft, and then a 33.33% for the final draft.
				</li>
				<li>
					After a final draft of a website is submitted, any other major work after that I either charge for a whole new project or start an hourly rate charge. I am reasonable on making certain accommodations for a project and especially if they were my mistakes, but once it starts becoming time-consuming I start charging for my time. The base rate for my time is $25 / hour.
				</li>
				<li>
					A contract must be signed by both of us before I start any project. 
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>
				Here are some things you want to think about before meeting up to discuss your website goals with me:
			</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>
					Are there any important features your website is going to require? An email newsletter system? A restaurant reservation system? An image gallery slider? These are nice functionality that can make your site stand out and look more professional or creative. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Imagine how you want your website to look like. What is the theme? The feel? The vibe? Stuff that makes up the overall theme of a website include things like the font, the layout of the content and images (how stuff is placed in the site), the color of the text, links, backgrounds, etc... So it will be a good thing to draw out the basic layout of your website on a piece of paper. It does not have to be perfect. Just know that the better you can describe your website, the more accurately I'll build it how you want it. And my priority is for me to build a website exactly how you want it.
				</li>
				<li>
					How many pages do you plan on having on your website? How are these pages going to be structured? The basic pages like the homepage, about, contact, and info are of course expected. But what other pages might you want your website to have? A menu page for a restaurant? And then a sperate page for each item in the menu displaying more information about that specific item like it's ingredients and who made that dish? Organizing your content will be important before putting up on a website and will make the building process of the website smoother.
				</li>
