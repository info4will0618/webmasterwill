			<p>
				Hello, my name is William Sanchez and I build effective websites.
			</p>
			<p>
				What are effective websites? 
			</p>
			<p>
				An effective website to me is a website that is awesome, unique, and informative. It does not have to be overly complicated, but it does need to get the point of your business/product/idea delivered.
			</p>
			<p>
				An effective website is a website that gets people interested about your product/service/idea. It provides enough information to get them engaged and curious about what you have to offer. It also immediately answers any critical questions people may have about your product or service.
			</p>
			<p>
				An effective website also needs to be easily navigatable. All the information is organized in such a way that it makes it easy for the viewer to find it fast. The more easily accessible the information is, the more engaged the viewer will be.
			</p>
			<p>
				In today's time's people do a lot of research before making any decisions. The internet has changed the landscape in which people do business. Your website is a virtual representation of your business. First impressions count, a lot. 
			</p>
			<p>
				A bad, plain, or ridiculous looking website makes your website look bad. People base a whole lot of trust on how your website looks.
			</p>
			<p>
				A website is extremely important and without one, you are losing a lot of potential for your business or profile. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But remember that a website is only as effective as you make it be. A website is an investment. The more you work on your website, the more effective it will be. And believe, having an effective website is one of the best investments you can make for your business.
			</p>
			<p>
				And the quality of your website determines the trustworthiness of your brand. Bluntly, if your website sucks then people think your brand or profile sucks even though you might offer a quality product, service, or any form of art or idea.
			</p>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are looking to build a website that is beautiful and unique and has my 100% support at all times, then you are in the right place. Your website is a huge representation of your business or profile. It's pretty much the virtual face of your business or profile.
			</p>
			<p>
				Now any basic website can be built using cheap web builder tools. But is that what you want? A basic website? I don't think so. Remember that a website is a huge representation of your business in today modern world. You want a website that stands out from the crowd. You also want a website that can communicate with your customer, fans, clients, readers, etc.. very well. Together we can achieve that.
			</p>
			<p>
				 Once you have a website set up, it won't stop there. Over time you'll realize that a static website is not a good website. Also that advertising a website is an extremely effective marketing strategy that does not require much to start. So if you are ready to start your website or improve one, then <a href="/webmasterwill/contact">contact me</a> as soon as you can!

						Let me confess something. I wouldn't know how to build the best website for you and your business. That is because I don't know enough about your business and customers. You see, I don't believe that I can (or anyone else) build a successful website unless I know as much as I can about your business and customers. As I said earlier before, your website is just a link between your business and your potential customers. And I believe the best website is a website that clearly and effectively communicates the values and benefits that your business provides to your customers. And that brings me to my last principle.

						Once I understand our business and who your customers or potential customers are, we can move forward to build a successful website. Using the best of my knowledge I can form ideas and strategies we can discuss to build a customer-driven website. But the thing is, we are going to require a lot of communication.

					<p>
						Conversion Rate Optimization(CRO) is just a fancy way of saying how good is your website at making visitors take action and turn into customers. 
						I know it's going to sound crazy. But people will decide whether they want to do business with you based on how your website feels and what it provides (content).
						Notice I said "feels". That is because it's not all about the looks. 
						When working on a website I focus on how it's going to make a person feel. That feeling is going to determine whether they want to do business with you or not.

					<p>
						When people enter your website they are asking questions like "is this for me?", "are they professional?", "do they understand my problem or desire"?, "can I trust them?". 
						I make sure all their questions are answered clearly, quickly, and easily through your website. If their questions are not answered quickly, clearly, and easily, we are risking them to leave to another business that will (oh no!).

						Everything from the words you choose and how you put them together to the pictures you choose has a subconscious impact in their minds. The subconscious mind is a powerful thing. It is where they truly make decisions and they don't even know it! But don't worry because we will win the hearts of our customers and make sure they want to do business with us.

					<h3>
						Why focus on conversion first? (which means making website visitors into customers)
					</h3>
					<p>
						A lot of people put a lot of effort and money trying to get as many visitors into their website as possible using social media, ad campaigns, word of mouth, etc. The problem is that if your website is not build to highly convert (turn them into customers), then a lot of your efforts can go to waste. 
						But if you focus on building a website at first that is good at turning visitors into customers, even though it might require more thought at first, you will save in advertisements and effort in the long run.
