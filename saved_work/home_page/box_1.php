					People are not going to do business with you because of how pretty your website is. As a matter of fact people are not going to do business with you because you have a website (I do believe having a website is still better than having no website at all). People are going to do business with you because you gave them a compelling reason for them to consider you. The point is, it's how you use your website that matters.

				<h3 class="home-content_sencondary-headings">
					Your website is a powerful tool. How you use that tool is going to make the difference between a few dollars and a ton of dollars!
				</h3>
				<p>
					The reason why some people think websites are not that great to invest in or they don't need one is because they don't know how to use them to represent their business. 
				</p>

				<p>
					That is the problem with most people and a huge reason why people don't think websites are all that useful.

					From the beginning, that a visitor lands on your website it's your mission to persuade the person to want to do business with you. It takes 5-10 seconds (some say 3) for a visitor to decide whether they are going to stay on a website or leave. Your first mission then is to make sure that visitor stays and read what you have to say. It does not matter if the visitor is a potential prospect or not, he/she must be extremely compelled to stay. Because if you can't retain the attention of people the first 3-10 seconds then you are greatly risking the potential amount of people who can be doing business with you. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The power is in the content and how you present that content. Successful businesses know that every aspect of your website matters. From the colors to the type of font you use. The amount of spaing you have between elements and where exactly you place those elements. 
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a reason why successful businesses have their own sales representatives. The sales representatives sole purpose is to find prospects, make a compelling presentation, and close the deal. Basically, they bring more people to buy from the business. Suess of the business greatly is affected by how well the salesman(or lady) can close the deal. 
				</p>
				<p>
					What is the main purpose of your website or future website? Depending on how you answer that question, that is going to determine how effective your website is going to be at bringing you more business.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I ask people what the purpose of their website is, they say something like "somewhere where visitors or potential customers can view more information about my business", or "somewhere where people can buy stuff from my business online". Those answers are valid and true of course, but they fall short when trying to build effective websites that actually bring you more business and in turn more money. You see, how you first define what a website is going to determine how you are going to build that website. Just having information about your business or information about the product you sell is not going to make customers or clients buy from you. It's how effectively you represent that information that matters. 
				</p>
				<p>
					When a visitor first lands on your website it takes about 5-10 seconds for them to make a decision on whether they are going to stay and keep viewing your website or go. How effective is your website or future website going to be on those first 5-10 seconds?

					The purpose of your website is going to define HOW you are going to build your website. And how you build your website is going to determine how effective your website os at bringing you, customers or clients.

					The missing element that separates a website that makes you little money vs one that makes a lot of money
				</h3>
				<p>
					What is the main purpose of your website? Or the main reason you plan on having a website? Whatever you answered is exactly what your website purpose is going to be. When I ask this question to most people, they answer me saying something like "a page where visitors or potential customers can view more information about my business", or "a place online where people can buy stuff from my business". The problem is that their websites become just what they answered. 
				</p>
				<h3>
					Why businesses dont make a lot of money with their websites
				</h3>
				<p>
					If your answer to the previous question was something like a place where people can learn more about my business or purchase something from my business, then thats eatly what its going to be. 
				</p>
				<h3>
					A website is one of the most powerful tools in your disposal
				</h3>
				<p>
					Typical businesses see websites either something unnecessary or something necessary because of the modern age we are in. Successful businesses see websites as an extremely powerful tool to help them escalate in the success ladder.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are many good businesses out there but because they don't implement this onept they lose many potential clients they can do business with. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Today many people are using the internet as their first stop to see if they want to do business with you or not. Why have a website that is not effective at making those people come in and do business with you? If you want to dramatically increase business success and profits, then you must make your website extremely effective at making visitors want to do business with you. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Breaking it down to the core, there are two things you must do to have a successful website. First you must be able to bring a bunch of people and specifically people who are most potentially going to buy from you to iew your website.  Second, when those people arrive, your website must most effectively sell your product or service to the potential client. When your client comes into your website, after reading some stuff they must want to buy.

					Now imagine this answer to that question. Your website is a page that most effetiely

					<h3 class="home-content_sencondary-headings">
						First let me ask you this deep question: How do you feel about investing in a website?
					</h3>
					<p>Quick question. What is the main purpose of your website?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Are you afraid that your investment in a website is like throwing money down a drain?
						</li>
						<li>
							Do you get headaches thinking about how complicated and time consuming dealing with a website is?
						</li>
						<li>
							Maybe you are wondering if your website is going to bring in enough customers/clients to your business to make your website worth the cost.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3 class="home-content_sencondary-headings">
						Change the way you perceive websites, and you'll see how they can make you a ton of money no matter what business you run
					</h3>
					<p class="home-content_paragraphs">
						If I were to ask you what a website is to your business, what will your answer be? When I ask this question to people, most of them seem to perceive a website as a place on the internet where anyone can find out more about their business or where anyone can purchase something from them. But then that's it. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Every website on the internet provides some form of information or can sell a product and/or service. The thing is, not every business website can do it effectively. And doing it effectively is huge! A difference that can multiply your income. You see, if your website <i>just</i> provides information about your business, people will <i>just</i> visit your website to view that information.
					</p>
					<p>
						But if your website can <b>entice, intrigue, and/or convince</b> their visitors with the information it provides, then your visitors are <b>A LOT MORE</b> likely to do business with you. Wait, I mean <b>WAY A LOT MORE</b> likely to do business with you. But how do you do that you wonder? ...
