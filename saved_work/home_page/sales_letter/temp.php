				<b>Attention fellow business owner or entrepreneur,</b>
			</p> -->

			<p>
				What if I told you that most websites out there suck at selling?  
			</p>

			<p>
				It's true.
			</p>

			<p>
				A lot of businesses don't bring enough sales back home because they don't know how to "sale" on their websites.
			</p>

			<p>
				Do me a favor because I think this will make you understand my point a bit more. Go onto google and search for a couple of local or online businesses and look at their websites. 
			</p>

			<p>
				How many of them convince you, from 1-10, to want to buy what they offer?
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, a more important question. Do you think you can change a few things to bump up your interest to what they offer?
			</p>

			<p>
				I bet you can.
			</p>

			<p>
				If a huge number of people can look at your website anytime, doesn't it make sense to bump up the level of interest as much as you can so you can get as many people interested in what you have to offer? Yes!
			</p>

			<p>
				Yet a lot of website owners don't put enough time and effort to think about what to put on their websites. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, do you want to have a website that sparks the biggest interest in your visitors so they are more likely to do business with you?  
			</p>

			<p>
				Good.
			</p>

			<p>
				But First... How Many Of You Have Felt This Way?

				What is a front end and what is backend?

				What is HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and so on? Do I have to deal with all this technical stuff when I build my website?

				How much time is this all going to take? I can't spend so much time learning all this stuff, I need to run my business! This is all so complicated and confusing!"
			</p>

			<p>
				"Should I use Wix, Wordpress, Shopify, a framework, or one of all the millions of options out there? Should I hire a freelancer or a web agency?"

			<p>
				"And what if I get ripped off? I cannot get all the time and money back if I get a website and it sucks or it stops working." 
			</p>

			<p>
				"What about advertising? Should I do it yet? How much money is that gonna cost? Should I just start with word of mouth and/or flyers or should I go full blown on online advertising?
			</p>

			<p>
				 Am I gonna get more money back than what I put in advertising in the first place? I'll be mad if my money goes to waste on ads."

				Hello, my friend, my name is William. I know how complicated the website world is.
			</p>

			<p>
				I know how it feels. Because wven when I was studying and working as a web developer, it was complicated. 
			</p>

			<p>
				But, there is one thing that I saw lack amongst many websites. And that was a good selling message. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The selling message is what is going to get more customers to your door, purchase a product, or make a call.
			</p>

			<p>
				But what exactly is the message?

				The Tragic Story of Bob and His Failed Attempt To Make a Website That Brings Him More Customers

				<img src="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root']; ?>/public/dist/imgs/home_page/1-up-for-a-challenge.png">
				<figcaption>"I got this"</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Once upon a time Bob wanted to start a new business.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bob knows he needs a website to have the best possible chance of his business becoming successful. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What should he do? Should he do it himself, invest some time with and little money with a website builder like Wix? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Or should he hire a freelance web developer for a decent price?
			</p>
			<p>
				 Maybe hire someone on Fiverr who does it for a ridiculously low price (with a huge concern on quality and expectations).
			</p>
			<p>
				Or perhaps he should be fearless and go all in with a web agency that not only builds custom beautiful websites but also throws some marketing in with it. After all, the fate of his business idea lies within a well-executed strategy!
			</p>
			<p>
				With an awesome custom built website built with the latest technology and some paid ads that go with it, there is no way it can fail! Right?
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Wrong...</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				After launch day Bob told all his friends and family and waited patiently for his phone and email to explode.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>But no one called...</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Bob even went passing out flyers and business cards but still... He hardly got the results he wanted.

				<figcaption>"Why is my website not making money!"</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				He told himself "Why is no one coming if my website looks beautiful and awesome"! (Crickets, Crickets...).

				Bob oversaw what I believe is the most important thing before building a selling website. The is <b>Crafting The Selling Message</b>.

				Don't Make The Same Mistake As Bob - How To Prevent a Wesite That Will Not Make Money and Drain Your Bank Account

				<img src="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root']; ?>/public/dist/imgs/home_page/61-charging.png">
				<figcaption>"This is what a huge mistake can feel like"</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Almost no person in the right mind is gonna buy something from you just based on the design or the technology behind the website. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I can still have a website built on Wix sell more than a website that custom build on Wordpress or another platform and still make more money on that website.
			</p>

			<p>
				Why? Because it's all about the underlying message behind the website.
			</p>

			<p>
				Ever been through a situation like Bob's or know someone who has gone through this? Hopefully not.
			</p>

			<p>
				Bob website failed at selling because he thought that having a good looking website with nice graphics, background, and everything will sway people to want to buy from him. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Now having a good design still matters, and it's has a huge impact on people, but without a selling message, it won't work. 
			</p>

			<p>	
				And if you do know someone, please give them my <u><a href="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root']; ?>/contact">number/email</a></u>. Maybe I can help them out!
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This story is not real. But I put it here because it's a general representation of how some people feel when they first built their website or after they have built their website and get no results. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Frustrated, lost, and disappointed on all the money they spent with no results. 
			</p>

			<h3>
				What is the Underlying Message In A Website?
			</h3>

			<p>
				Today, having a beautiful design on a website or having it built on are not the only things you need to succeed with your website..
			</p>

			<p>
				Also note that spending money, time, and effort on stuff like online ad's, SEO, and even word of mouth without knowing what to do can be costly. Not knowing exactly whether your money is gonna be worth the advertising cost is worrisome, and if your money does go to waste it, like I said before, can be extremely frustrating. 
			</p>

			<p>
				But what if I told you there is a major step or frame of mind that is often overlooked that guarantees that your website is most likely to make visitors into customers and your advertising strategies to return more money?
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm not trying to fool you into anything, It's true. I call it The <b>Selling Strategy</b>.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm not gonna guarantee that you are gonna make a bunch of money using my selling strategy. I don't know what product, service, or idea you have and how much people like it. 
			</p>

			<p>
				But what I will guarantee is that your promoting, marketing, and selling efforts will be much more effective.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you are just starting out building a website for your business or self, don't start building it without having a selling strategy. But if you already have a website with some traffic (visitors), doing this will boost your sales dramatically.
			</p>

			<p>
				I truly believe that not having a selling strategy is the reason most websites fail and don't make as much money as they can, bring in as many customers as they can, and why a lot of advertising money is thrown down the drain.
			</p>

			<p>
				So if you want to save yourself some frustration, headaches, and money, then I suggest you keep on reading...
