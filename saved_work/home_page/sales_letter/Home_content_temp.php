<h3>

				There is a gap between your business and the whole world. You need to find a way to fill that gap. 

			</h3>

			<p>
				Ok, what is the selling strategy?
			</p>

			<p>
				The selling strategy is just planning and strategizing the advertising done on YOUR website.
			</p>

			<p>
				Advertising is not a simple thing when done professionally. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Good advertising requires a lot of research, thought, creativity, and testing. 
			</p>

			<p>
				It truly is an art and science.
			</p>

			<p>
				And also understand that advertising is done on your website is different from the advertisement done online or in the outside world.
			</p>

			<p>
				Advertisement done on the outside is to get people attention and make them come to your website. Advertisement done on your website is to persuade them to actually buy and take action.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you want to make more money, then you must understand how to do both types of advertisement. 
			</p>

			<!-- <p>
				Two main reasons. First, because it's cheaper. Second because if you do advertising on your website first, it makes outside advertising more worth the investment.
			</p> -->

			<h3>
				A Word On Professional Advertising
			</h3>

			<p>
				There is a reason why they pay advertisers for the job they do.  Other than it requires creativity and hard work, it connects the gap between the person who buys and the person who sells (you).
			</p>

			<p>
				People in general are not gonna come to you to buy or put in the work to figure out if they want to buy from you.
			</p>

			
			<p>
				YOU must work to persuade people to want to do business with you, to listen to your idea or to do anything. People will never (and will hardly ever put the effort) to figure out the value of your business or idea. 
			</p>

			<p>
				That is unless they really need your product or service. But if that is the case that means you probably have other competitors who are looking for your visitors business as well. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In that situation, you will need to use your advertisement to be different and more interesting than your competitors. 
			</p>

			<p>
				You are gonna have to use advertising to stand out from the crowd.
			</p>

			<h3>
				Don't Underestimate Advertising Done On Your Website!
			</h3>

			<p>
				For some reason, people put a lot of time and money on outside advertising. I consider outside advertisement to be stuff such as google ads, facebook ads, SEO, or paper ads, word of mouth and so on. Aything that brings people to your website.
			</p>

			<p>
				But advertising efforts shouldn't stop on the outside. Advertising should also continue on the website itself. 
			</p>

			<p>
				If you use your website to get more customers (which I highly recommend you do) then I believe you should start advertising from the inside out. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Meaning, you should first worry about advertising on your website and then everywhere else.
			</p>

			<p>
				Why? 
			</p>

			<p>
				For Three main reasons.
			</p>

			<p>
				First, advertisement on your own website is cheaper to begin with. 
			</p>

			<p>
				 You don't have to pay google, facebook, youtube, print flyers, make posters, or anything. 
			</p>

			<p>
				You can start with the text. It's pretty much free (only what you have to pay for hosting your website) and it can have a huge impact.
			</p>

			<p>
				You can improve advertising by just thinking and planning more deeply about what to write on your website.
			</p>

			<p>
				Second, improving advertising on your website first will make your ALL outside advertising, if done right, return more on investment.  
			</p>

			<p>
				Remember, that all other forms of advertisement lead to a single point, which is your website.  
			</p>

			<p>
				That means changing one thing on your website will affect all other advertising.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now if you think about it, it reinforces my first point. It's cheaper and more effective to change inside the advertising and affect all outside advertising.
			</p>

			<p>
				 If you try to change outside advertising but your inside advertising sucks, you might be wasting too much money and energy which is not good. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Quick note. You should still work on a planning and good strategy on your outisde advertising. Just because you have good advertising on the inside does not mean you have good advertising on the outside. 
			</p>

			<p>
				If no one is visiting your website, then there is no point on having good inside advertising. They are both affect each other.  
			</p>

			<p>
				And the third reason (finally), is that all the same ideas and concepts you apply to the advertisement of your website can be applied to the outside forms of advertising advertisement.
			</p>

			<h3>
				Not All Content Is Advertising
			</h3>

			<p>
				Having content such as text, videos, pictures that are about your business is not advertising. Advertising takes a whole different form of communication. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Now don't get me wrong, some businesses do have some advertising going. But in my humble opinion, it's not enough.
			</p>

			<p>
				And then there are other businesses that don't have almost any advertising going on. (not good).
			</p>

			<p>
				A lot of websites just tell you information about the business, they don't sell you on it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Telling is not selling and selling is not telling.  
			</p>

			<p>
				The difference is the way something is communicated. Think about a newspaper and a magazine.
			</p>

			<p>
				Most of the time the magazine is trying to sell you something and a lot of time people buy stuff or consider buying stuff on magazines. 
			</p>

			<p>
				You read newspapers to be informed. It is until you reach the ad area in the newspaper that you starts making you wanna consider to buy some stuff if it interest you. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Now believe it or not, most websites are written like a newspaper or blog. Technical, boring, bloated with unecessary information and all about them. 
			</p>

			<p>
				That's not selling. If you want your website to sell, then you must make your website about your customers and turn into a 24/7 ad.
			</p>

				Imagine you are looking for a place to eat because you are soooooo hungry.  Oh great, you have three nearby restaurant. So you visit their websites and compare all three.
			</p>

			<p>
				But you want to choose the best restaurant you can to satisfy that hunger. 
			</p>

			<p>
				So you search online for an Italian place that serves pizza (because who does not like pizza, right?).
			</p>

			<p>
				The first reads: Welcome to William Italian restaurant. Serving great pizza since 1995. There is a picture of me preparing some pizza and then the menu at the bottom. Hmmm... ok.
			</p>

			<p>
				The second reads: Welcome to the most awesome restaurant in Los Angeles.  
			</p>

			<p>
				We have the best pizza in town so come on in and grab a bite. Then you have a picture of a gigantic looking pizza.
			</p>

			<p>
				Hmmm... Looks good huh? For sure I might go with this one but let's look at the last one (you know almost everyone will consider all choices before picking unless they are so desperately hungry and can't take it anymore).
			</p>

			<p>
				There are three Italian restaurants on the Google local search, so you compare the three. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The third reads: Are you hungry? Want to sink your teeth into a hot fresh Italian pizza made with real natural ingredients that make your taste buds go insane. Come on in, I promise you will like it or I'll give you your money back. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Picture: A man eating a pizza so furiously that his whole shirt is stained with tomato sauce and cheese.
			</p>

			<p>
				Oh, wait. Let's throw in a little "This week are throwing a FREE cheesecake along with your pizza, come in and get your hands on some delicious pizza and dessert while the offer last!". (Make sure is on the front page!).
			</p>

			<p>
				Yes more words. Yes more advertising and exaggeration. Yes more sales.

			<p>
				Selling on the web is way different than selling on magazines, newspapers, billboards, or anything else. 
			</p>

			<p>
				And part of making a good selling strategy is knowing how people behave on the web. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The selling strategy is just finding out what is the best way to make a visitor (potential customer) want to buy from you. 
			</p>

			<p>
				It sounds simple, but it is not.
			</p>


			<p>
				It requires a lot of thought and research.
			</p>

			<p>
				And the amount of thought and research is going to depend on what type of business you have.
			</p>

			<p>
				It also requires an understanding of human behavior itself.
			</p>

			<p>
				And there will be a lot of experimenting, changing, and testing.
			</p>

			<p>
				Advertising is actually pretty hard. And I know it can be overwhelming. 
			</p>

			<p>
				If you want to build a website that brings result and sells, then you must study professional advertising
