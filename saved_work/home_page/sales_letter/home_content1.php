			Do you spend a lot of money and time advertising your website but get frustrated when you cannot get any people to buy?

		<p>
			Or maybe you want to build a new website and want to make sure you build it right the first and don't waste a bunch of money and save yourself from frustration and headaches.

			I see a lot of people who are frustrated because they are wasting too much time and money on web services and not getting any results with their websites. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Yet when I look at their websites, they all have one thing in common, they suck at selling. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I know, it's a bold statement but I really believe <b>it's true.</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			No matter how much advertisement you pay for, or how much you tell people about your website, if you can't sell it effectively to them they won't buy.
		</p>
		<p>
			And if they don't buy you end up wasting a bunch of money and end up frustrated like everyone else who spends so much money on ads. 
		</p>
		<p>
			At WebMasterWill, I show you how to make not just a website, but a website that sells.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I'm gonna show you what mistakes you should be avoiding and what selling techniques you can be using to start making more people interested in your business today. 
		</p>

		<p>
			That means a website that is designed so it actually makes people interested in your business and wants to pick up the phone to call you, make a purchase, or walk into your store.

		<h2>
			Why Most Websites Fail At Selling (And What You Should Do To Avoid Such Fate)
		</h2>
		<figure class="home-page_figure">
			<img src="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root']; ?>/public/dist/imgs/home_page/19-shocked.png">
			<figcaption>"Hello there, this is WebMasterRobo and I'll be guiding you through this reading"</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			So why do most websites suck at selling?
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Simply because people don't know how to sell and they don't why other people buy.
		</p>

		<p>
			Go to google and search up any business websites around you and tell me which ones really grab your attention and make you highly consider their services? 
		</p>

		<p>
			People put so much time and money on stuff like SEO, online ads, and content thinking it's the only way to make more money with your website.
		</p>

		<p>
			The problem is that getting even though you get more traffic to your website, it still does not mean that your website is good at selling.
		</p>

		<h3>
			What Is Selling? (And Why You Should Care)
		</h3>

		<p>
			Let's define what selling is and why you should care about selling. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Selling is the art of motivating or persuading someone to want to buy. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There is one thing you must know about how people buy. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There is one thing you must know about how people buy. 
		</p>

		<p>
			People are not gonna put the effort to figure out or think about why they should buy from you. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It is your job to give them that reason. 
		</p>

		<p>
			If you have a product or service that is in high demand it might not require a lot of effort to sell at first, but that probably means you have a lot of competitors. 
		</p>

		<p>
			They are gonna search your competitor's websites and compare them to your website. 
		</p>

		<p>
			In this situation, it is your selling skills that are gonna separate you from your competition. 
		</p>
		<!-- <p>
			For example, do a quick google search on a couple of small business websites around you.
		</p>
		<p>
			What you are going to see is that the website mostly talks about their businesses.
		</p>
		<p>
			Who they are, what they do, when they started, and blah blah blah. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm saying these things are not good, what I am saying is that they don't sell. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When people and look at your website they are looking for how you are going to help them.
		</p>
		<p>
			In other words, they come with an interest for themselves.
		</p>
		<p>
			The website that can talk directly to them about what they want is gonna win their business.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Yet when you look at most websites, you are gonna see that they mostly talk about their themselves.
		</p>
		<p>
			But they almost never really talk about the customer's problems, pains, needs, want (just like I did in the intro of this writing). 
		</p>
		<figure class="home-page_figure">
			<img src="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root']; ?>/public/dist/imgs/home_page/23-love.png">
			<figcaption>"You have to win the customers heart before they give you access to their wallet/purse!"</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			Talking mostly (and some websites only) about your business is not good because it does not motivate people to buy.
		</p>

		<p>
			That is because when people visit your website they are interested in themselves, especially at first. 
		</p>
		<p>
			When people come into your website they are asking questions like: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				What can this company do for me?
			</li>
			<li>
				Do they understand my problem?
			</li>
			<li>
				Is my investment in this business gonna be worth the money?
			</li>
			<li>
				Can I trust this business with my money?
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The more you can relate to the customer with your website, the more likely they are gonna want to buy from you.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want a website that makes people interested in your business, then you must make it about them first. 
		</p>
		<p>
			This is just one example (but really significant) of the reasons why websites today don't sell. 
		</p>
		<p>
			A few other reasons why websites don't sell include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Websites don't know how to structure and format text on the internet and therefore it makes it hard for people to read. Not only will it be hard to read, but they also WILL NOT read your text at all. This is not good if you are trying to sell your product or services to them. 
			</li>
			<li>
				A lot of websites don't use psychological copywriting techniques that make people interested in what you have to offer. Copywriting is the art of motivating people using your words to take action. If you don't employ such selling techniques then you will not be using your words to their full potential to get more customers. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Websites don't use selling techniques like surveying people or give discounts for referring people which can help your business out immensely and increase profits!
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Here at WebMasterWill, when I create a website, I make sure to always put the customer pains, problems, needs, wants first.
		</p>
		<p>
			After all, they are the ones that are gonna give us the money.

		<p>
			Time and time again I see people focusing on the wrong idea of what a good website that sells is.  
		</p>
		<p>
			And because of this, they end up building a nice looking website but one that sucks at selling.

		<h3>
			If You Know Why They Buy, Then You Know How to Sell It To Them
		</h3>
		<p>
			If you want a website that sells, moves your business forward and brings more money to your pockets then you must understand what makes people buy first. 
		</p>
		<p>
			People buy because they are <b>interested in themselves.</b> 
		</p>
		<p>
			It sounds simple, but it can actually be quite complicated.
		</p>
		<p>
			That is because it requires a big shift in the way you think about web design.
		</p>
		<p>
			And despite being simple, people who build websites break this principle all the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			They make a website all about the business and almost nothing about the user. 
		</p>
		<p>
			They talk about their business/product/service, but not how their business, product or service can benefit the customer. 
		</p>
		<p>
			They put up pictures of the business staff, but not a picture of a customer who is enjoying the product or service they are offering.

<!-- 		<h3>
			Change The Way You See Your Website And You Will Open A Whole New World Of Possibilities
		</h3>
		<p>
			The problem I see with a lot of website owners and website creators alike, is that they built a website with their own eyes.
		</p>

		<p>
			That means they built it on how they think it should look, what it should say, and how it should work. 
		</p>

		</p>
			<b>But that is the wrong way of seeing things if you want people to buy</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			You have to build a website with your customer's eyes. 
		</p>
		<p>
			You have to get in your customers head and see what they think about your website, how they feel and think about your product/service, and how they use your website. 
		</p>
		<p>
			And once you start building a website in their eyes, you'll start seeing that they are more likely to want to buy from you.

			They will not think and put the effort to find out whether or not they should buy from you.

			Now if you have a product or service that is a high need and does not require a lot of motivation to get people to buy it, then you most likely have competitors who are looking for your business. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In this situation, it is your selling ability that is going to win people over your competitors.

		<p>
			One quick note about how to selling: <b>Don't talk too much about your business and more about your customers. </b>
		</p>
		<p>
			One thing I see a lot of website owners do is just put up information about their business and who they are on their websites.

			What You Need to Know About Web Design And How it Affects Your Sales
		</h3>
		<figure class="home-page_figure">
			<img src="<?php echo $cfg['site']['root']; ?>/public/dist/imgs/home_page/47-gears.png">
			<figcaption>"It's not all about design, it's how people use it too. "</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
			You can have good selling tactics but if your web design sucks then people are not gonna stick around to hear about them. 
		</p>
		<p>
			People generally interact with website a certain way and the more you understand how people use websites the more you can build one that provides a pleasant experience for them. (a pleasant selling experience!).
		</p>
		<p>
			One interesting example is that generally, people don't read all the words on your website (have you been reading all the words in my website?). 
		</p>
		<p>
			That is because people actually scan or skim through your website quickly to figure out what all your content is all about.
		</p>
		<p>
			Therefore you must write content is such a way that is simple for people to scan and motivate them to read. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Another thing you must understand about good web design is that people prefer things that are simpler than overly complicated. 
		</p>
		<p>
			So having a good website structure that makes it easy to navigate to certain information is better than having a web page with all the information scattered everywhere. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I see a lot of business web design flaws that could be causing the people to leave.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Stuff like videos playing in the background is distracting elements that are not good web design. 
		</p>
		<p>
			At WebMasterWIll I try my best to build a website with good web design. Good web design can give a huge boost to selling your products and services online.

		<!-- <ul>

			</li>
			<li>
				Design - How the design makes a person feel. 
			</li>
			<li>
				
			</li>
		</ul> -->
		<!--
		<p>
			To build a website that sells you also need to change your perspective on what a website is. 
		</p>

		<p>
			A lot of business owners perceive their websites to be just a place where people can view information about their business and what they do. 
		</p>

		<p>
			A lot of websites online are technical, boring, and mostly talk about the business they represent.
		</p>

		<p>
			They don't interest or motivate people to buy. 
		</p>

		<p>
			If you want to interest people, then you must talk about them.
		</p>

		<p>
			Stuff like their problems, ideas, desires, etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			
		</p>

		<p>
			They mostly talk about how awesome their businesses are and why people should choose them. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But talking about your business is not going to make people want to buy.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you want a website that sells then your website has to be mostly about your customers, not your business. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Your website should also be easy to understand and navigate.
		</p>

		<p>
			A lot of website owners and even website design agencies believe that having a modern looking design with flashy buttons or videos playing in the background are gonna make people want to buy.
		</p>

		<p>
			But those things don't make a website sell more.
		</p>

		<p>
			 And what a lot of people think is "awesome design" can actually be bad design that is hurting the chances of people wanting to buy from you (like a video playing in the background).
		</p>

		<p>
			What makes a website sell is simple design that people can easily understand and use.
		</p>

		<p>
			A design that structures information easily for them to find so they can be sure they are making the right choice with you.
		</p>

		<p>
			What is gonna sell is the words, pictures, and quality videos that you put on your website that evoke emotion on people and make them interested in your product or service.
		</p>

		<p>
			And I'm not talking about information about your business or pictures of your office. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Here at WebMasterWill I build websites that are designed to make more people become customers or make a purchase.
		</p>

		<p>
			I can give you many reasons but I want to keep this message as simple as possible.
		</p>

		<p>
			But first, what do I mean by selling?
		</p>

		<p>
			Selling is the art of making people want to buy from you and take action. 
		</p>

		<p>
			A lot of people build a website with the mindset that a website is just a place where people can view information about their product or service. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Instead, you should your website as a place where you are gonna give a sales presentation about your business. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Just like Steve jobs gave his presentations about apple products. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, that might have been a bit exaggerated. But know that no matter how big or small your business is or what product or service you are selling you can always give a better sales presentation. 
		</p>

		<h3>
			What Are Websites Doing Wrong
		</h3>

		<p>
			A lot of business websites are too technical and boring.
		</p>

		<p>
			They only talk about their business or company but almost never talk about the person that is visiting the website. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The websites don't give enough reason or motivation for the person to want to buy. They don't evoke any emotion or deep thoughts. 
		</p>

		<p>
			If you want more people to buy your product or service than you need to know how to sell it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And no matter what business and product/service you have, there is always a way to sell it better. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Selling and websites are two different things. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But when combined together they can be a powerful money making asset for your business. 
		</p>

		<h3>
			What is selling?
		</h3>

		<p>
			Selling is the art of making people want to buy from you and take action. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Most websites are up with just information (and sometimes even too little information).
		</p>

		<p>
			There is one thing you must understand about people.
		</p>

		<p>
			People, without a reason or motivation, are not gonna want to buy from you.
		</p>

		<p>
			That is unless they have a high need for your product/service. 
		</p>

		<p>
			In that case then you probably have competitors who are looking for the same business.
		</p>

		<p>
			In either case, it is selling that is going to make people want to buy or pick you over your competitors. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Most business websites online are filled with information but they are not really selling.
		</p>

		<p>
			The difference between information and selling is communication. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Information does not make people move. 
		</p>
		<p>
			But when you sell you make them think and feel more. You make them understand better and want to learn more about you.
