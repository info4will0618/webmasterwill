				Do you want to get more customers, leads, fans, or sales from your website? 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Are worried you about investing money on a web developer or agency to later realize they let you down?
			</p>

			<p>
				And I bet you don't want to invest so much money on a website if it's not gonna bring you more business in return. 
			</p>

			<p>
				If you are always busy on your business, you don't want to deal and put in so much time with learning all about the technical stuff about websites. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The problem is that most people focus on the WRONG things. 
			</p>

			<h3>
				How To Build A Website That Makes Money Instead Of Wastes Money
			</h3>

			<p>
				There are a lot of good web developers and web agencies with good talent and creative skills. 
			</p>

			<p>
				But the thing is that most people build websites on what they think is good or looks good.
			</p>

			<p>
				 
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, this is OK if you are building a website for yourself.
			</p>

			<p>
				But if you really want to make money from your website you have to realize that you are actually building a website for your visitors/customers. 
			</p>

			<p>
				You must look at your website in the eyes of the customer. 
			</p>

			<p>
				They don't know anything about you, they don't know if they should trust you or your product. 
			</p>

			<p>
				It is your website's job to do everything possible to convince them that they should buy. 
			</p>

			<h3>
				A sub
			</h3>

			<p>
				Once you start building a website with your customer's eyes instead of your you will realize that you need to approach websites in a different way.
			</p>

			<p>
				To build a successful website based on the person point of view, you have to take a few things into consideration: 
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					First, not everyone is gonna be your customer. You must talk on your website like you are speaking directly to those that are most likely to become your customer. 
				</li>
				<li>
					You must understand how people use the web. Today people are in such a hurry. If you cannot get their attention and interest with your website, you'll be missing out on a lot of customers. 
				</li>
				<li>
					You must understand customers own behavior and how they make decisions. For example, people prefer things that are easier to understand and appeal more to them. 
				</li>
				<li>
					You must understand that not all web design is "good". Some websites that are simpler can outperform websites that have nice widgets, graphics, and videos.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				And I can keep going on and on. But what I want you to take away from this is that you have to build a website for the people if you want to make money.
