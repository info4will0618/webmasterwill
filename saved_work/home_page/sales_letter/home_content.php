				What if I told you that most websites out there suck at selling their product or services. 
			</p>

			<p>
				It's a bold statement, but <b>it's true</b>.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are many business owners who are worried, frustrated, and disappointed at their sales. 
			</p>

			<p>
				But when I take a look at their website, I can see a lot of them who are not putting enough effort to use it to help their business out.
			</p>

			<p>
				And then there are those website or business owners that don't know how much money they can actually be making with their websites.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Your website is a money making asset!</b>
			</p>

			<h3>
				
			</h3>

			<h3>
				Selling Website
			</h3>

			<p>
				Since you are here I know that you care about the success and future of your business and about having more money in your pockets.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you want to make more money with your website, then you need more than just a website, you need a selling website.
			</p>

			<p>
				What is a selling website you ask?
			</p>

			<p>
				Good question but first, do me a favor because I think this will open your eyes and you can benefit from it.  
			</p>

			<p>
				Go onto google and search for a couple of local or online businesses and look at their websites.
			</p>

			<p>
				How many of them really convince you, from 1-10, to at least consider what they have to offer?
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, another interesting question. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Do you think you can change a few things on those websites to bump up your level of interest at least one point higher to consider what they offer?
			</p>

			<p>
				I bet you can.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now imagine how much more money would those businesses make if they changed a few things? 
			</p>

			<p>
				If those websites had 1,000 visitors every month, how much more profit will they be making if they bump up the level of interest on their websites by 10%?

			<h3>
				Your Website Is The Future
			</h3>

			<p>
				Let me ask you a couple more questions! (We are about to become really good friends).
			</p>

			<p>
				Do you remember the last time you purchased something from a store or was looking for some type of service?
			</p>


			<p>
				And before entering the store or calling the company, did you visit their website?
			</p>

			<p>
				If you are like most people, you most likely did.
			</p>

			<p>
				And also, depending on the type of business you were looking for, not only did you check out their website, but also all competitor's website. 
			</p>

			<p>
				That's crazy! Research shows that more than 88% of people are going to check out your website and do research before them make a buying decision.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the future, pretty soon, that number is going to be closer to 100%!  
			</p>

			<p>
				Stuff like tv ads, radio ads, magazines and newspapers, billboards, flyers, and almost anything that is similar are losing their effectiveness.
			</p>

			<p>
				The next time someone needs to go to a dentist, dine in at a restaurant or bar, hire a lawyer, or buy some shoes, I can guarantee that they are likely gonna pop out their phones and look at the websites of those businesses.
			</p>

			<p>
				The world is moving towards the internet. One day every person is going to use the internet to make decisions. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Your website is the new store-front of the future.
			</p>

			<p>

			<h2>
				First, Why Selling Is Important and Why You Should Care If You Want Your Business To Succeed
			</h2>
			<p>
				
			</p>
			<p>
				Selling is the art of convincing people to want to buy from you.
			</p>
			<p>
				One thing you must understand about people are not going put the work to figure out whether they want to buy from you.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is your job and your websites job, to do the work of telling them why they should buy from you. 
			</p>
			<p>	
				If you have competitors, then the website who sells better is gonna win. 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is why you should care about selling because it can make a huge impact on sales and success for your business.
			</p>
		</div> -->

		<div>
			<h3>
				Why Most Websites Suck At Selling?
			</h3>

			<p>
				So why is it that most websites suck at selling? 
			</p>

			<p>
				There are two main reasons I can think of.  
			</p>

			<p>
				The first is that business owners or website owners don't think it's important enough to have or improve a website.
			</p>

			<p>
				I believe this is a huge mistake because I believe your website can be a powerful money making asset or your business. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Second is that they just don't know how to sell. 
			</p>

			<p>
				And it's not a bad thing. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Selling, just like any other skill has to be learned. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Many people think that having a nice looking website built with the latest technology and advertising it on google or social media gonna make people want to buy.
			</p>

			<p>
				Those things are important and they do help.
			</p>

			<p>
				But at the end, those things alone are not gonna sell.
			</p>

			<!-- <p>
				What is gonna sell is how you make them feel after they look at your website. 
			</p> -->

			<h3>
				What is Selling?
			</h3>

			<p>
				There is one thing you must understand about people, so listen carefully. 
			</p>

			<p>
				People, without reason or motivation, will not buy from you.
			</p>

			<p>
				If they do have a high need for your product or service then you don't need a lot of motivation for them to look for you.
			</p>

			<p>
				But if that is the case then you probably have competitors looking for the same clients as you. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In either case, where they have a need or not, it is your selling ability that is gonna win their decisions to buy.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since the dawn of time, there have been salesmen or women. There have been advertiser and promoters.
			</p>

			<p>
				Your website is no exception Your website is the salesperson of our time. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Selling is the art of getting people's interest in our product and service and telling them why they should buy it and how it will benefit them. 
			</p>

			<p>
				People are not gonna put an effort to think about why they should buy from you.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				And people are most likely to go to those who they find more interest and trust on.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is not up to them, but up to you to present them with the reason on why they should buy from you. 
			</p>

			<h3>
				Why Should You Care About Selling
			</h3>

			<p>
				Your business depends on it.

			<h2>
				What Does It Take To Create A Selling Website
			</h2>
			<p>
				Selling on the web is different than selling in a newspaper/magazines, tv, radio, or even selling in person. 
			</p>
			<p>
				First, you must understand who your potential customers are and how they use the web. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Second, you have to create a selling strategy and how to best present that strategy with your website.
			</p>
			<p>
				This takes work, time, and effort. 
			</p>
			<p>
				But I assure you that constructing your website this way will increase your website sales and benefit your business.

				How I Can Help You Create A Selling Website
			</h2>
			<p>
				Here at WebMasterWill, I help you with not just building a website, but a website that sells. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I teach you how people use the web and how they make buying decisions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I'll help you create a selling strategy that will make people very interested in what you have to offer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember that your website is up every day, 24/7, serving your visitors and customers.  
			</p>
			<p>	
				Imagine what a website that sells do for your business compared to one that does not.
			</p>
			<p>
				Imagine how much more will you make if your website can bring 2x, 3x, 5x, or more people to be interested in what you have to offer?

<!-- 			<p>
				Selling and a website are two different things.
			</p>

			<p>
				Also, selling is something that is done seperate from the website. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Before creating the website itself, you must have a selling strategy to know what to put on your website.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you don't, it is very likely your website is not gonna be good at selling.
			</p> -->

			<h3>
				Viewing your website through your visitor's eyes
			</h3>

			<p>
				There are a lot of good web developers and web agencies that build some pretty good websites. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The thing is that a lot of these people (including website owners) build a website based on what they themselves think a website should be like.
			</p>

			<p>
				What happens is that they only focus on what an ideal website should look like and how people are going to use it.
			</p>

			<p>
				And when it comes to writing content, the website owner mostly writes about their business. Who they are, what they do, how they work, etc.
			</p>

			<p>
				And usually it's written or presented (video) in a long technical and boring way.
			</p>

			<p>
				The problem is that visitors are not gonna see and even use your website the way you think they.
			</p>

			<p>
				And people, especially at first don't really want to know so much about your business, but how your business can benefit their life. 
			</p>

			<p>
				So if you want to to build a website that sells, you should build it not with your eyes (or the eyes of the web developer), but with the eyes of the customer.
			</p>

			<p>
				That means you need to understand who your visitors are, what their problems or desires are, and how they can benefit from your product or service. 
			</p>

			<p>
				That's' what most of your website content should be about.
			</p>

			<p>
				You must also know how people behave on the web. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Now I can write a whole essay on how people will use your website, but that will be too much on this page.
			</p>

			<p>
				 But just understand that people will use your website different than what you would think when you build it.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, people are not gonna read every word on your website. They skim through your website. (I assume you skimmed this whole writing first before trying to read everything).
			</p>

			<p>
				That means you need to understand who your visitors are, what their problems or desires are, and how they can benefit from your product or service. 
			</p>

			<p>
				That is what most of the content on your website should be about.

			<h3>
				Learn To Sell
			</h3>

			<p>
				There is a reason why salesman (or woman) and advertisers get paid for the work they do. 
			</p>

			<p>
				There is also a reason why a lot of advertising money and efforts go to waste. 
			</p>

			<p>
				If you want to build a website that sells, then you must understand the art of selling.
			</p>

			<p>
				The reason we need to learn how to sell is that people naturally are not motivated or will work to figure out if they need what you have to offer.  
			</p>

			<p>
				Therefore it is your job to persuade them to want to do business with you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Also, note that people if you sell something that is highly needed (people look for it), you most likely have other competitor's that people are comparing you with.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this situation, your ability to sell and good advertisement is going to do a great deal when differentiating you to your competitors. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, selling is another topic that can require pages to write and talk about. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Just know that selling is the ability to make a person take action on your product and service.
			</p>

<!-- 		<div>
			<p>
				Now viewing your website in your customer's eyes is only half of the equation. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Learning how to sell to them is the other half.
			</p>

			<p>
				There is a reason why advertisers and salesman or women get paid for what they do. 
			</p>

			<p>
				People need motivation or reason for them to take action.
			</p>

			<p>
				And it is through your content that you are going to do that. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The words you choose and how you put them together. The pictures you choose and how they make them feel. The colors, fonts, and background image all have an effect on your visitor.

				Once upon a time Bob wanted to start a new business.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bob knows he needs a website to have the best possible chance of his business becoming successful. 
			</p>
			<p>
				What should he do? Should he do it himself, invest some time with and little money with a website builder like Wix? 
			</p>
			<p>
				Should he hire a freelance web developer for a decent price?
			</p>
			<p>
				Maybe hire someone on Fiverr who does it for a ridiculously low price (with a huge concern on quality and expectations).
			</p>
			<p>
				Or perhaps he should be fearless and go all in with a web agency that not only builds custom beautiful websites but also throws some marketing in with it. After all, the fate of his business idea lies within a well-executed strategy!
			</p>
			<p>
				With an awesome custom built website built with the latest technology and some paid ads that go with it, there is no way it can fail! Right?
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Wrong...</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				After launch day Bob told all his friends and family and waited patiently for his phone and email to explode.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>But no one called...</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				Bob even went passing out flyers and business cards but still... He hardly got the results he wanted.
