				Are You Losing Money By Not Having a Website That Is Able to Convert Visitors Into Customers Effectively?
			</h2>

					<p>
						A lot of business today (do I dare say most) don't have websites that are good at bringing more customers to their business. It does not matter if the website is pretty, if it's not good at making you more money then it's worthless.
					</p>
					<p>
						With the rise of mobile phone users, people more than ever are checking out business websites before they buy. 
					</p>
					<p>
						That means that if your website sucks, you will be losing money! Even worse! Your competitor can be taking away all your customers if people like their website better. 
					</p>
					<p>
						I make sure that your website is well optimized that it surpasses each and every one of these points and more
					</p>
					<p>
						Now you must be thinking why am I so confident saying these things. So let me explain. But first I want you to check out the bullets on the right or bottom.

							You have about 5 seconds to convince a visitor to stay before they leave your website?

						</li>
						<li>
							People at first don't read every word on your website. People first scan your website before they even decide whether they want to read the rest. 
						</li>
						<li>
							Most websites copy suck.
